# Gear Reducer Design — CATIA V5

## Overview
This repository presents the design of a **gear reducer** created in **CATIA V5** as part of a **Machine Design (OM)** university course.  
The reducer is engineered with a **calculated reduction ratio of 4.75** and follows **strict mechanical design standards** to ensure correct fit, durability, and operational reliability.

The entire project focuses on applying real-world engineering practices, including shaft design, tolerance selection, gear dimensioning, bearing lifespan calculations, and assembly considerations.  
Special attention has been given to **maintenance accessibility**, **structural rigidity**, and **component standardization**.
